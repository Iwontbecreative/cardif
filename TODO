Things to do:
- Calculate some models with AWS:
	RFC 1000 trees gini
	ETC 1000 trees entropy
	ETC 1000 trees entropy
        T-SNE on some variables (not all ?)
- Test whether we can have good predictions with SVM by changing the features (<0.48)
- Implement a NN such as lasagne
- Test meta-bagging
- Can we use something other than XGB to combine our models output ?
- Add loging to both first_level and cardif
- Develop second_level
- Shorten (delete ?) cardif
- Find out if we are slightly overshooting or undershooting and adjust.
