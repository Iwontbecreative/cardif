Key variables:
v10, v12, v21, v34, v40, v50, v114, v129

Split seems to be ok because:
Running KS test, we cannot reject the null hyp for any var
The mean prediction seems to be the same acording to LB

For GBT, mean prediction is 0.77 so we're overshooting by just a little bit
if we accept the hypothesis that the means are the same.

Warning: Currently small changes such as variable scaling are impossible to
test as the differences might all be seed-related. One way to test those
would be to run CV but this is currently way too slow. They are 2 possible
fixes : run in a faster computer or use less variables for testing.
