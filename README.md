# Data competition : BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management challenge 

This repository hosts my top-5% solution to [Kaggle's BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management)

Some classical problems encountered here:
- Handling NA's
- Handling categorical variables (LabelEncoding vs OneHotEncoding depending on algorithms)
- Feature engineering using Naive Bayes methods (handling of issues linked to generalization, overfitting, etc.)
- Ensembling (done via stacking, see *first_level.py* and *second_level.py*
